<h4>Objective </h4><br>
For the Maven Northwind Challenge, I was working as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world. <br>
As part of the role, I've been tasked with building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in key areas, including:
<br>
Sales trends <br>
Product performance <br>
Key customers <br>
Shipping costs <br>
 <br>
<h4>Key Findings:</h4>
 <br>
KPI CardThe revenue trend is on the rise and in 2015 it has been rising continuously. There is a substantial spike in revenue from Dec 2014 to Jan 2015 by almost 32%.Â  <br>
The average shipping time overall is 8.49 days but United Package is taking more than 9 days for it. <br>
Till now the total shipping cost is USD 64942.689. <br>
Cote de Blaye is the best-selling product so far, generating USD 110,000 followed by Thuringer Rostbratwurst, and Raclette Courdavault. <br>
The top 3 customers (Quick-Stop, Ernst Handel & Save-a-lot Markets) have contributed to 25% of the total revenue. <br>
Our Client reach is mostly in Europe, and North and South America, with most orders from the USA, Germany & Austria. The high scope of expansion is remaining in North and South America. <br>
